#St. Petersburg Metrostation Parser
This is a programm that can basically be applied to any subway scheme. The scheme itself is uploaded in JSON format. By parsing lines, stations, and connection, we get a station index.
This index is used to build a route from A to B entered by a user. The programm shows the list of stations with connections, as well as time required to get to the final destination.
There are also loggers that gather the statistics of searches and input errors.
